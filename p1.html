<h2 style="color: red;">Why Programmers Should Learn Python in 2018?</h2>
<p>If you are thinking to learn Python but not sure why you should do that then here are 10 reasons which highlight the benefits of learning Python in 2018.</p>

<p>Though, the questions depend upon who is asking that i.e. for a beginner, learning Python makes sense because its simple and main reason for learning Python is simplicity.</p>

<p>Similarly, for an experienced programmer who is looking to go into Data Science and Machine learning, learning Python makes sense because it’s quickly becoming the most used programming language and there are powerful APIs and library available for AI, Data Science, and Machine learning.</p><br>

Anyway, without any further ado, here are my 10 reasons to learn Python in 2018:<br>

<h4 style="color: magenta;">1. Data Science</h4>
This is the single, biggest reason why many programmers are learning Python in 2018. I know many of my friends who are bored with their Java programming jobs in Investment banks are learning Python on Udemy to make a career in Data Science due to exciting work and high pay.<br>

But, what makes Python a preferred language for Data Science and Machine Learning? Didn’t R was considered best for that not too long ago? Well, I think the libraries and framework Python offers e.g. PyBrain, NumPy and PyMySQL on AI, DataScience, and Machine learning are one of that reason.<br>

Another reason is diversity, Python experience allows you to do a lot more than R e.g. you can create scripts to automate stuff, go into web development and so much more.<br>

If you are interested in becoming a Data Scientist in 2018 and looking for pointers, I suggest you check out Data Science, Deep Learning, & Machine Learning with Python course on Udemy. I have purchased this course and it’s one of the awesome resources. You can get it in less than $10 sometimes.


<h4 style="color: blue;">2. Machine Learning</h4>
This is another reason of why programmers are learning Python in 2018. The growth of machine learning is phenomenal in last a couple of years and it’s rapidly changing everything around us.

Algorithms become sophisticated day by day, the best example is Google’s Search Algorithms, which can now answer what you are expecting. There are Chatbots around to answer your queries and Uber is totally driven by Algorithms.

If you are interested in machine learning, want to do a pet project or just want to play around, Python is the only major programming language which makes it easy.

Though there are machine learning libraries available in Java, you will find more content around Python as developer community is preferring Python over anything else on Data Science and Machine learning.

If you are interested in doing web development with Python, I suggest you to further check Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science course on Udemy


<h4 style="color: cyan;">3. Web Development</h4>
The good old development is another reason for learning Python. It offers so many good libraries and frameworks e.g. Django and Flask which makes web development really easy.

The task which takes hours in PHP can be completed in minutes on Python. Python is also used a lot for web scrapping. Some of the popular websites on the Internet like Reddit is built using Python.

If you are interested in web development using Python I suggest you to join the Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp course by JoshPortilla.


In fact, there is a free Python course on Udemy which will teach you that while teaching Python.

<h4 style="color: violet;">4. Simplicity</h4>
This is the single biggest reason for beginners to learn Python. When you first start with programming and coding, you don’t want to start with a programming language which has tough syntax and weird rules.

Python is both readable and simple. It also easier to setup, you don’t need to deal with any classpath problems like Java or compiler issues like C++.

Just install Python and you are done. While installing it will also ask you to add Python in PATH which means you can run Python from anywhere on your machine.

<h4 style="color: purple;">5. Huge Community</h4>
You need a community to learn a new technology and friends are your biggest asset when it comes to learning a programming language. You often get stuck with one or other issue and that time you need helping hand.

Thanks to Google, you can find the solution of your any Python related problem in minutes. Communities like StackOverflow also brings many Python experts together to help newcomers.

<h4 style="color: aqua;">6. Libraries and Frameworks</h4>
One of the similarities between Python and Java is the sheer number of open source libraries, frameworks, and modules available to do whatever you want to do. It makes application development really easy.

Just imagine creating a web application without Spring in Java or Django and Flask in Python. It makes your job simple as you only need to focus on business logic.

Python has numerous libraries for different needs. Django and Flask are two of the most popular for web development and NumPy and SciPy are for Data Science.

In fact, Python has one of the best collection of machine learning and data science libraries like TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Keras, Pandas and many more.

If you want to learn more about Python machine learning libraries, I suggest you to join the Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp course, one of my favorite.


<h4 style="color: yellow;">7. Automation</h4>
When I first come to know about Python was due to one of my scripting need. I was working with an application which receives messages over UDP and there was a problem, we were not seeing messages in the log.

I wanted to check if we are receiving any UDP traffic on that box and that port or not but I couldn’t find a handy UNIX command to do that.

One of my friend, who sits next to me was learning Python and he wrote a utility in just 5 minutes to intercept UDP message using one of the Python modules.

Obviously, I was impressed with the time it took for him to write such a tool but that just highlights the power of Python when it comes to writing scripts, tool and automating stuff.

If you seriously want to know how much Python help with automation, my favorite place is the Automate boring stuff with Python book, simply awesome book.


<h4 style="color: green;">8. Multipurpose</h4>
One of the things I like about Python is its Swiss Army knife nature. It’s not tied to just one thing e.g. R which is good on Data Science and Machine learning but nowhere when it comes to web development. Learning Python means you can do many things.

You can create your web applications using Django and Flask, Can do Data Analysis using NumPy, Scipy, Scikit-Learn, and NLTK.

At a bare minimum, you can use Python to write scripts to automate many of your days to day tasks.

<h4 style="color: blue;">9. Jobs and Growth</h4>
Python is growing really fast and big time and it makes a lot of sense to learn a growing programming major programming language if you are just starting your programming career.

It not only help you to get a job quickly but also it will also accelerate your career growth. IMHO, for beginners, after simplicity, this should be the most important reason to learn Python

<h4 style="color: red;">10. Salary</h4>
Python developers are one of the highest paid developers, particularly in the Data Science, Machine learning and web development.

On average also, they are very good paying, ranging from 70,000 USD to 150,000 USD depending upon their experience, location, and domain.
